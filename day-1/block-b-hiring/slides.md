<!-- Talk track: Block B — Hiring and Team Formation. This is the post-lunch block, so bring energy and start with the provocative cost-of-bad-hire framing. -->

<!-- _class: title -->

# Hiring & Team Formation

## Day 1 — Block B | 13:30–15:10

**LO: Produce a structured hiring packet that improves signal and fairness**

<!-- Talk track: Welcome back from lunch. This block is about the single highest-leverage activity you will do as a manager — hiring. A great hire compounds for years; a bad hire compounds damage for months. By the end of this block, you will have a complete hiring packet: job description, work sample exercise, scoring rubric, and interview loop design. Let's get into it. -->

---

# Why Hiring Is Your Highest-Leverage Activity (1/2)

### The Compounding Effect of Great Hires

- A great **analyst** makes every PM smarter — they reframe questions and surface data no one asked for
- A great **data engineer** makes every analyst faster — reliable pipelines mean insight, not CSV cleaning at 2 AM
- A great **analytics manager** attracts other great people — talent compounds on itself

<!-- Talk track: I want to start by making the case that hiring is not just important — it is the single highest-leverage thing you do as a manager. Think about compounding. A great analyst does not just produce good analyses. They make every product manager smarter because they reframe questions, surface data nobody thought to ask for, and raise the quality of every decision in their orbit. A great data engineer does not just build pipelines — they make every analyst on the team faster because the data is reliable and well-documented. -->

---

# Why Hiring Is Your Highest-Leverage Activity (2/2)

### The Negative Compounding of Bad Hires

- A bad analyst ships wrong numbers — stakeholders lose trust, the team loses its seat at the table
- A bad data engineer builds fragile pipelines — every analyst inherits tech debt
- **Trust in analytics is uniquely fragile** — one bad number in a board deck and your credibility is gone for a year

<!-- Talk track: And it works the other way too. A bad analyst ships a wrong number in a board deck, and suddenly the CFO does not trust anything from your team. A bad data engineer builds fragile pipelines and every analyst inherits tech debt. Analytics is uniquely fragile here because our product is trust. One bad number and your credibility is gone for a year. -->

---

# Hiring Returns Compound

> Hiring is the one activity where the returns — positive or negative — compound long after the decision is made.

- Engineering ships code — if it breaks, you can see the error
- Analytics ships numbers — if they are wrong, sometimes nobody notices for months
- By the time the damage surfaces, trust is already gone

<!-- Talk track: This is the key insight. Engineering has a feedback loop — broken code throws errors. Analytics does not. A wrong number can circulate through a board deck, influence a strategy decision, and nobody catches it for months. By the time they do, the damage is done. That is why hiring well in analytics is even more critical than in other functions. The returns, positive or negative, compound long after the decision is made. -->

---

# The State of Analytics Hiring

### The Market Reality

- Data roles have grown **~650% in the past decade** — demand has exploded, but hiring practices have not kept up
- Most data job descriptions are **wish lists**, not role designs
- The majority of analytics interviews are **unstructured** — a casual chat that predicts almost nothing
- Top candidates have **multiple offers** and they are evaluating you as much as you are evaluating them

<!-- Talk track: Let's talk about the hiring market for a moment. Data roles have exploded — something like 650 percent growth over the last decade depending on which report you read. But here is the problem: hiring practices have not kept up with the demand. Most data job descriptions are still wish lists. Most analytics interviews are still unstructured — a hiring manager chats with the candidate for 45 minutes and then makes a gut call. Meanwhile, the best candidates have three or four offers. They are interviewing you as much as you are interviewing them. -->

---

# What the Best Companies Have Figured Out

- **Stripe** built structured interviews for data roles with calibrated rubrics and blind-reviewed take-homes
- **Airbnb** invested in making every candidate interaction reflect their values — even rejection emails
- These companies win talent not because they pay the most, but because their process **signals competence and respect**

> When a candidate goes through a well-structured interview, they think "these people know what they are doing — I want to work here."

<!-- Talk track: The companies that figured this out — Stripe, Airbnb, and others — they win talent not by paying the most but by running a process that signals competence and respect. When a candidate goes through a well-structured interview, they think "these people know what they are doing — I want to work here." That is the competitive advantage of a good process. -->

---

# What We'll Build This Block (1/2)

### Four Deliverables, Connected

```
  Role Design         Work Sample         Scoring Rubric       Interview Loop
  ───────────    →    ───────────    →    ──────────────   →   ──────────────
  90-day outcomes     Realistic task      Predefined           Who evaluates
  drive the JD        tests real work     dimensions + scale   what, and how
                                                               you decide
```

<!-- Talk track: Let me preview what we are building in the next 100 minutes. You will leave this block with four connected deliverables. First, a job description built around 90-day outcomes — not a skill shopping list. Second, a work sample exercise that simulates the actual job. Third, a scoring rubric with predefined dimensions and a four-point scale. Fourth, an interview loop design that specifies who evaluates what and how you make the final decision. These four things are not independent — they are a system. -->

---

# What We'll Build This Block (2/2)

### The Four Deliverables

- The **Job Description** grounds everything in outcomes, not skills
- The **Work Sample** tests whether a candidate can actually do the job
- The **Rubric** ensures consistent, fair evaluation across interviewers
- The **Interview Loop** structures who evaluates what and how you decide

<!-- Talk track: The job description grounds everything in outcomes, not skills. The work sample tests whether a candidate can actually do the job. The rubric ensures consistent, fair evaluation across interviewers. And the interview loop structures who evaluates what and how you decide. Each piece feeds the next — they form a coherent system. -->

---

# Why These Four Connect

- The outcomes in your JD determine what your work sample tests
- Your rubric dimensions map to what the work sample reveals
- Your interview loop assigns evaluators to rubric dimensions

### Later This Block

Your hiring packet will be used in a **role-play exercise** where you will conduct a structured interview with a classmate acting as a candidate. You will experience both sides — interviewer and candidate — and stress-test your rubric against a real human being.

<!-- Talk track: These four pieces form a system. The outcomes in your JD determine what your work sample tests. Your rubric dimensions map to what the work sample reveals. Your interview loop assigns evaluators to rubric dimensions. And here is why this matters: later this block, you will use this packet in a role-play. You will actually conduct a structured interview with a classmate playing a candidate from a profile card. So build something you are willing to use for real. -->

---

# The Cost of a Bad Hire (1/2)

- Average cost of a mis-hire: **1.5–2x annual salary** (SHRM, Bradford Smart)
- In analytics specifically, a wrong hire means:
  - **6 months of bad dashboards** that erode stakeholder trust
  - Broken credibility with the business — "analytics never delivers"
  - Team morale damage — good people leave when surrounded by poor performers

<!-- Talk track: Let's start with stakes. Why does hiring matter so much in analytics? Because analytics is a trust business. The average cost of a mis-hire is one and a half to two times annual salary. But in analytics, the real cost is worse. If your first hire ships bad dashboards for six months, the VP of Product stops asking your team for help. They go hire a contractor or build their own spreadsheet. You lose your seat at the table. -->

---

# The Cost of a Bad Hire (2/2)

- The **"brilliant jerk"** problem: technical skill without collaboration destroys team culture faster than incompetence

> "The best thing a manager does is hire well. The second best thing is fire fast when they don't."
> — Ben Horowitz

<!-- Talk track: And the brilliant jerk — the person who is technically excellent but impossible to work with — they will drive away every collaborative person on your team. The cost is not just salary. It is organizational trust. As Ben Horowitz puts it, the best thing a manager does is hire well. The second best thing is fire fast when they don't. -->

---

# Role Design Before Recruiting

**Don't start with a job description. Start with outcomes.**

### The Role Scorecard Approach

1. **What does this person need to accomplish in their first 90 days?**
2. Define 3–5 concrete outcomes, not a laundry list of skills
3. Work backward from outcomes to required capabilities

<!-- Talk track: Most hiring processes start wrong. Someone says "we need a data scientist" and the hiring manager opens a Google Doc and starts listing skills — Python, SQL, Tableau, machine learning, PhD preferred. That is a shopping list, not a role design. Instead, start with the question: what does this person need to accomplish in their first 90 days? Three to five concrete outcomes. Then work backward to what capabilities are actually required. -->

---

# Role Design: An Example

| 90-Day Outcome | Capability |
|:---|:---|
| Instrument top-3 user flows | SQL + analytics engineering |
| Deliver weekly KPI dashboard | Visualization + communication |
| Scope first A/B test | Experimental design basics |

> The resulting JD looks nothing like a skills shopping list.

<!-- Talk track: Here is a concrete example. A seed-stage startup needs their first analytics hire. Instead of listing 25 skills, you write down three 90-day outcomes: instrument the top user flows, deliver a weekly KPI dashboard, and scope the first A/B test. Now work backward — what capabilities are actually required? SQL and analytics engineering, visualization and communication, and basic experimental design. That is your job description. Notice how different this looks from "PhD required, 10 years of Python." -->

---

# JD Anti-Pattern: The 25-Bullet Requirements List

> *"Required: Python, R, SQL, Spark, Hadoop, Tableau, Power BI, Looker, dbt, Airflow, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, GCP, machine learning, deep learning, NLP, time series forecasting, A/B testing, causal inference, stakeholder management..."*

**What this signals:** "We do not know what this person will actually do."

<!-- Talk track: Before you write your JD, let me show you the anti-patterns. I have collected these from real job postings — names removed to protect the guilty. Pattern one: the 25-bullet requirements list. Python, R, SQL, Spark, Hadoop, Tableau, Power BI — it goes on and on. What this tells a candidate is that you have no idea what this person will actually do. Good candidates self-select out because they do not have all 25, even though no human does. -->

---

# JD Anti-Pattern: The Unicorn

> *"PhD in Statistics required. 10+ years of experience. Must thrive in a fast-paced startup." — Compensation: €75K–€85K*

**What this signals:** "We want Staff-level talent at Junior-level comp."

<!-- Talk track: Pattern two: the unicorn. PhD required, ten years of experience, startup mentality — for 80K. This tells senior candidates you either do not understand the market or you are hoping to find someone desperate. -->

---

# JD Anti-Patterns (continued)

### Pattern 3: The Copy-Paste

> A JD clearly written for a software engineer, with "data scientist" find-and-replaced in. Mentions "code reviews" and "shipping features" but nothing about analysis or stakeholders.

**What this signals:** "We do not understand what this role is. You will spend your first six months explaining your job to your own manager."

> Each of these anti-patterns actively repels the candidates you want most.

<!-- Talk track: Pattern three: the copy-paste. This is a software engineering JD with "data scientist" swapped in. It mentions code reviews and sprint velocity but nothing about stakeholders, analysis, or decision support. The candidate reads this and thinks "they do not even know what this role is." Each of these anti-patterns actively repels the candidates you want most. The best people have options — they will close the tab and move on. -->

---

# What Level Do You Actually Need? (1/2)

| Level | What They Do | Autonomy | Scope |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Junior** | Executes well-defined analyses | Needs clear specs | Single tasks |
| **Mid** | Scopes own work, communicates findings | Self-directed on known problems | Projects |
| **Senior** | Influences strategy, mentors others | Navigates ambiguity | Team-wide |
| **Staff/Principal** | Org-wide impact, shapes practice | Sets direction | Cross-team |

<!-- Talk track: Before you write the job description, get honest about what level you actually need. This is where a lot of managers get it wrong. A seed-stage startup does not need a Staff Data Scientist. They need someone who can write SQL, build dashboards, and communicate clearly — that is a strong mid-level hire. -->

---

# What Level Do You Actually Need? (2/2)

### Common Leveling Mistakes

- Hiring **senior** when you need **mid** — you pay for strategy but need execution
- Hiring **mid** when you need **senior** — they cannot navigate your ambiguity

> Leveling mistakes are expensive because the wrong-level hire will either be bored or overwhelmed, and both lead to attrition.

<!-- Talk track: Conversely, if you are at a Series B and your entire analytics function is one person embedded with a product team, you probably need a senior who can navigate ambiguity and influence without authority. Leveling mistakes are expensive because the wrong-level hire will either be bored or overwhelmed, and both lead to attrition. -->

---

# The Leveling Conversation

### Having an Honest Discussion with Your Hiring Partner

The leveling conversation is the one you have with your recruiter, HR partner, or finance lead before you open the role. It is often uncomfortable.

**The tension:**
- You need a Senior Analyst who can navigate ambiguity and influence PMs
- Finance approved headcount for a Mid-level role
- Recruiter: "post as Senior, see who applies" — it's a trap

<!-- Talk track: This is the conversation nobody teaches you to have. You have done your role design, you know you need a Senior Analyst who can navigate ambiguity and influence product managers. You take this to your recruiter or your finance partner and they say "the budget is for a mid-level hire." Now what? Some managers cave and post a mid-level role hoping to find a unicorn. Others post "Senior" in the title but offer mid-level comp, which is the unicorn JD anti-pattern we just talked about. -->

---

# The Leveling Conversation: Pressure to Level Down

- **"We can train them up"** — Sometimes true for Junior to Mid. Rarely true for Mid to Senior. The gap is judgment, not skills.
- **"Let's hire two juniors instead of one senior"** — Two juniors without a senior mentor means two people making the same mistakes.
- **The hidden cost:** A mis-leveled hire costs more than the salary difference between Mid and Senior.

<!-- Talk track: Let me talk about the pressure to level down. You will hear "we can train them up" — sometimes true for junior to mid, but rarely true for mid to senior because the gap is judgment, not skills. You will hear "let's hire two juniors instead of one senior" — but two juniors without a senior mentor means two people making the same mistakes. The hidden cost of a mis-leveled hire is always more than the salary difference. -->

---

# The Leveling Conversation: How to Have It

1. **Bring the outcomes list** — "Here is what this person needs to accomplish in 90 days. What level can do this?"
2. **Name the trade-offs** — "If we hire Mid, I need to budget 30% of my time for mentoring. Is that what we want?"
3. **Get alignment in writing** — A verbal "sure, hire a senior" turns into "why did you approve that comp?" without documentation

<!-- Talk track: Here is how to handle it. Bring your outcomes list. Say "here is what this person needs to accomplish in their first 90 days — scope their own work, influence product roadmaps, present to the exec team. What level of hire can do this?" Make the trade-offs explicit. If you hire mid-level, you need to budget 30 percent of your own time for mentoring and air cover. Is that what the organization wants? Sometimes the answer is yes — just make sure everyone agrees. And get the alignment in writing because memory is short when the comp review comes around. -->

---

# Your First Hire: Analyst vs. Analytics Engineer

**Before writing your JD, ask:** Does my case context need someone to analyze data, or someone to make data analyzable?

| Signal | Analyst | Analytics Engineer |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Data state | Clean, warehouse exists | Messy, no single source of truth |
| First 90 days | Deliver insights | Build pipelines + metrics layer |
| Key skill | SQL + storytelling | SQL + dbt + orchestration |

> If the data is a mess, your first hire is the person who cleans it — not the person who analyzes it.

<!-- Talk track: Before you write your job description, I need you to ask yourself an honest question. Does your case context need an analyst — someone who takes clean data and turns it into insights? Or does it need an analytics engineer — someone who takes messy, scattered data and turns it into something an analyst can actually use? MSBA students consistently underestimate the data engineering reality. If you picked DataPulse, your data lives in Mixpanel, Stripe, and spreadsheets. An analyst cannot analyze data that does not exist in a queryable form. You need an analytics engineer first. If you picked MarketBridge, you have conflicting metric definitions. You need someone to build the canonical metrics layer before anyone can trust the numbers. This is the most common hiring mistake in analytics — hiring the analyst before the plumbing is in place. -->

---

# Hiring in the AI Era (1/2)

**Your candidates will use AI. Plan for it.**

- LLMs can write SQL, draft analyses, and generate visualizations
- If your work sample tests execution speed, you are testing the AI, not the candidate
- **What to test instead:** Framing, judgment, communication, and knowing when the AI is wrong

<!-- Talk track: I want to address something that changes hiring fundamentally. Your candidates are using AI tools. ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude — they are using them during your work sample exercise. And honestly, they should be. The question is not whether candidates use AI. The question is what you are testing. If your work sample asks a candidate to write a SQL query, an LLM can do that in seconds. So your work sample is no longer testing SQL skill — it is testing whether the candidate knows which LLM to use. That is not what you want. -->

---

# Hiring in the AI Era (2/2)

**Redesign work samples for the AI era:**

- **Allow AI use** — then evaluate: did they validate the output?
- **Test framing** — Can they define the right question before touching any tool?
- **Test judgment** — Can they spot when the AI is subtly wrong?
- **Test communication** — Can they explain findings to a non-technical stakeholder?

<!-- Talk track: Here is how to redesign your work samples. Allow AI use — even encourage it. Then evaluate what the candidate did with the AI output. Did they validate it? Did they add judgment the AI could not provide? Did they catch the edge case the model missed? The framing question is now even more diagnostic than before. A candidate who jumps straight into prompting an AI without first defining the problem is doing the same thing as the candidate who jumps into writing code without thinking. Test whether they can frame the question, evaluate the answer critically, and communicate the findings in business terms. The meta-skill you are hiring for now is knowing when the AI is wrong. That requires domain knowledge, statistical intuition, and intellectual honesty — exactly the things you cannot automate. -->

---

# The Research on Structured Interviews (1/2)

### Predictive Validity (Schmidt & Hunter, 1998)

| Method | Correlation |
|:---|:---|
| Unstructured interviews | **~0.20** |
| Structured interviews | **~0.51** |
| Work samples | **~0.54** |

<!-- Talk track: This is the most important table in the deck. These numbers come from decades of industrial-organizational psychology research, primarily Schmidt and Hunter's landmark 1998 meta-analysis. An unstructured interview predicts job performance at a 0.20 correlation — barely better than flipping a coin. A structured interview jumps to 0.51. Work samples hit 0.54. -->

---

# The Research on Structured Interviews (2/2)

| Method | Correlation |
|:---|:---|
| Cognitive ability tests | **~0.51** |
| Reference checks | **~0.26** |
| Years of experience | **~0.18** |

> Years of experience is the worst predictor — yet most JDs filter on it first.

<!-- Talk track: Cognitive ability tests also hit 0.51. Reference checks are at 0.26. And notice that years of experience is at the very bottom at 0.18. The thing most JDs filter on first is the worst predictor on the list. That should change how you write every job description. -->

---

# What the Research Tells Us

**Key insight: Gut feeling is mostly noise. Structure = fairness + signal.**

- Structured interviews are the **single biggest improvement** you can make — free
- Work samples outperform every other method because they **directly observe** the work
- Years of experience is the **worst predictor** — yet it's the top filter on most JDs
- "I know a good hire when I see one" = **noise as intuition**

<!-- Talk track: So what do we do with this? The takeaway is that moving from unstructured to structured interviews is the single biggest improvement you can make to your hiring process, and it is free. You do not need to buy software or hire a consultant. You need to write down the questions in advance, ask every candidate the same questions, and score the answers against predefined criteria. That is it. -->

---

# Structure Also Means Fairness

- Unstructured interviews amplify **affinity bias** — you hire people who remind you of yourself
- Structured interviews force you to evaluate **evidence against criteria**, not vibes
- This is not bureaucracy. This is how you find signal in a process riddled with bias.

> When you are just chatting, you gravitate toward people who remind you of yourself. Same school, same hobbies, same communication style. Structure breaks that pattern.

<!-- Talk track: Here is the fairness angle — unstructured interviews amplify affinity bias. When you are just chatting, you gravitate toward people who remind you of yourself. Same school, same hobbies, same communication style. A structured process forces you to evaluate evidence against criteria instead of vibes. Some people hear "structure" and think "bureaucracy." I hear "structure" and think "the only way to find signal in a process that is drowning in noise." -->

---

# Designing Work Samples (1/2)

### What Makes a Good Work Sample?

- **Reflects actual job tasks** — not LeetCode puzzles for analytics roles
- **Has clear evaluation criteria** — defined before candidates see the exercise
- **Respects candidate time** — 2–4 hours maximum, clearly communicated
- **Tests judgment, not just technique** — "What would you do next?" matters more than "Can you write a LEFT JOIN?"

<!-- Talk track: The work sample is the centerpiece of your hiring process. For analytics roles, this is not a coding test. It is a simulation of the actual job. A good work sample reflects actual job tasks, has clear evaluation criteria defined in advance, respects candidate time, and tests judgment — not just technique. -->

---

# Designing Work Samples (2/2)

### Analytics Work Sample Example

> *"Here is a messy dataset of user activity logs and a business question from the VP of Product: 'Should we invest in improving our onboarding flow?' Walk us through your approach, your analysis, and your recommendation."*

<!-- Talk track: Here is a concrete example. You give candidates a realistic dataset — messy, with some known issues — and a business question. Then you evaluate how they frame the problem, how they execute the analysis, and how they communicate the findings. -->

---

# What Work Samples Really Evaluate

How they **frame** the problem > How they **execute** the analysis > How they **communicate** the findings

- **Framing** is the most diagnostic — do they ask clarifying questions? Do they identify what is out of scope?
- **Execution** — is the analysis sound? Do they handle missing data thoughtfully?
- **Communication** — can they explain findings to a non-technical stakeholder?

<!-- Talk track: Let me break down what you are really evaluating in order of importance. First, how they frame the problem. Do they ask clarifying questions? Do they identify what is out of scope? Second, how they execute. Is the analysis sound? Do they handle missing data thoughtfully? Third, how they communicate. Can they explain their findings to a non-technical stakeholder? The framing question is the most diagnostic because it reveals whether someone can operate independently or needs everything spelled out for them. -->

---

# What Work Samples Really Evaluate (cont.)

> The framing question reveals whether someone can operate independently or needs everything spelled out.

<!-- Talk track: Framing is the highest-signal dimension: someone who can operate independently will naturally ask clarifying questions and define what is out of scope before diving in. If they skip straight to the data, that tells you something too. -->

---

# Work Sample Design: Realism and Respect (1/2)

### Balancing Realism and Candidate Time

- The work sample should feel like **a real day on the job**, not a homework assignment
- State the expected time upfront: **"This should take 2–4 hours. We do not expect or want you to spend more."**
- Provide the dataset, the business question, and the context — do not make candidates guess what you want

<!-- Talk track: Let me get specific about work sample design because the details matter a lot. First, respect candidate time. State the expected time commitment upfront and mean it. Provide the dataset, the business question, and the context. Do not make candidates guess what you want. -->

---

# Work Sample Design: Realism and Respect (2/2)

### Making Work Samples Inclusive

- **Do not assume tool access** — "Use whatever tool you are comfortable with: Python, R, Excel, SQL, pen and paper"
- **Provide the rubric upfront** — candidates should know what dimensions they are being evaluated on
- **Allow flexible formats** — slide deck, written memo, Jupyter notebook, or recorded video

<!-- Talk track: Second, make the exercise inclusive. Do not require a specific tool. Some of the best analysts I have worked with do their exploratory work in Excel before moving to Python. If you require Python, you are filtering for tool familiarity, not analytical ability. Third — share the rubric with the candidate. This is not a trick. You want to see their best work on the things that matter. Allow flexible formats — slide deck, memo, notebook, or video. -->

---

# Work Sample Design: Setting Up for Success

- **Include a data dictionary** and note known data quality issues
- **Provide a contact for clarifying questions** — set up for success, not gotchas

<!-- Talk track: Set candidates up to succeed. Include a data dictionary, note known data quality issues, and give them a contact for clarifying questions. You want to evaluate their analytical thinking, not their ability to reverse-engineer your data model. -->

---

# When Candidates Go Above and Beyond

- Some candidates will spend 15 hours on a 4-hour exercise. **Do not reward this.** Score against the rubric, not effort or volume.
- Doing the minimum well is a **signal of prioritization and judgment** — exactly what you want in an analyst.
- Going above and beyond is not a negative, but it should not substitute for quality on core dimensions.

<!-- Talk track: Now, when candidates go above and beyond — and some will spend 15 hours on a 4-hour exercise — do not reward that. It actually tells you something concerning about their ability to scope and prioritize. A clear, concise deliverable that nails the core dimensions is more impressive than a 40-slide deck. You are evaluating thinking, not production value. -->

---

# Why a Rubric? (1/2)

### The Case for Predefined Dimensions

- Score on **predefined dimensions**, not overall impression
- Prevents: halo effect, anchoring, recency bias, "culture fit" as a catch-all
- Forces interviewers to articulate *what* they are evaluating

<!-- Talk track: Let me make the case for why a rubric is not optional. You score on predefined dimensions, not overall impression. This prevents the halo effect, anchoring, recency bias, and the use of "culture fit" as a catch-all. It forces interviewers to articulate what they are actually evaluating. -->

---

# Why a Rubric? (2/2)

### What Happens Without a Rubric

- The debrief becomes a **storytelling contest** — whoever tells the most compelling anecdote wins
- Interviewers default to **overall impression**: "I liked them" or "Something felt off"
- **Halo effect** takes over — one strong dimension inflates all scores
- **"Culture fit"** becomes a catch-all for affinity bias in disguise

<!-- Talk track: Without a rubric, your debrief meeting becomes a storytelling contest. The most articulate interviewer, or the most senior person in the room, tells a compelling anecdote about the candidate, and everyone else anchors to that story. You end up evaluating the interviewer's narrative skills, not the candidate's abilities. The halo effect takes over — a candidate who is great at communication gets inflated scores on technical execution. And "culture fit" becomes a catch-all for "I would want to get a beer with this person." -->

---

# What a Rubric Makes Possible

- Each interviewer independently rates **specific dimensions** with **behavioral anchors**
- The debrief shifts to **calibration**: "I gave a 2 on Business Context because they never connected the analysis to a decision"
- Disagreements become **productive** — they reveal information, not just preferences

> Without a rubric, disagreements are opinion collisions. With a rubric, they surface the most important information about a candidate.

<!-- Talk track: With a rubric, the conversation changes. Instead of "I liked them," it becomes "I gave a 2 on Business Context because when I asked how the analysis would inform a decision, they could not connect the dots." That is a specific, actionable observation. And when two interviewers disagree — one gave a 3 on communication, the other gave a 2 — that disagreement becomes productive. You ask "what did you see?" and you learn something. Without a rubric, disagreements are just opinion collisions. -->

---

# Dimensions for Analytics Roles

| Dimension | What You Are Looking For |
|:---|:---|
| **Technical Execution** | Sound methodology, clean analysis, handles edge cases |
| **Communication Clarity** | Explains findings to non-technical audience |
| **Business Context Awareness** | Connects analysis to decisions and outcomes |
| **Intellectual Curiosity** | Asks good questions, explores beyond the obvious |

<!-- Talk track: For analytics hires, I recommend four dimensions: technical execution, communication clarity, business context awareness, and intellectual curiosity. You can adapt these, but I would not go above five dimensions — more than that and your interviewers lose focus. Each dimension should map to something you can observe in the work sample or the interview. -->

---

# The 1–4 Scale (No Fence-Sitting) (1/2)

Use a 4-point scale. Not three, not five.

| Score | Meaning |
|:---|:---|
| **1** | Below the bar — significant concerns |
| **2** | Approaching the bar — some gaps |
| **3** | Meets the bar — effective in this role |
| **4** | Exceeds the bar — exceptional, raises the team |

<!-- Talk track: Now, the scale. Use a four-point scale. Not three, not five. A three-point scale lets everyone pick the middle and avoid making a real evaluation. A five-point scale creates the illusion of precision — nobody can reliably distinguish between a 3 and a 4 on a five-point scale in a 45-minute interview. -->

---

# The 1–4 Scale (No Fence-Sitting) (2/2)

> Most scores should be 2s and 3s. If you are giving many 1s and 4s, your calibration is off or your pipeline needs work.

- A **1** means below the bar — significant concerns
- A **4** means exceptional — this person raises the team
- Four points forces a meaningful distinction

<!-- Talk track: Four points forces a meaningful distinction. A 1 means below the bar. A 2 means approaching but there are gaps. A 3 means they meet the bar. A 4 means exceptional. Most of your scores should be 2s and 3s. If you are giving many 1s and 4s, your calibration is off or your pipeline needs work. -->

---

# Calibrating Scorers: The Problem (1/2)

### Without Calibration, Scores Are Meaningless

- Interviewer A thinks "3" means "could do the job"
- Interviewer B thinks "3" means "among the best I have seen"

<!-- Talk track: Let me show you why calibration matters. Imagine two interviewers — one thinks a 3 means "could do the job" and the other thinks a 3 means "among the best I have seen." Without calibration, your scores are just numbers without a shared reference point. -->

---

# Calibrating Scorers: The Problem (2/2)

| Interviewer | Tech | Comm | Biz Context | Curiosity |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Hiring Manager | 3 | 3 | 2 | 3 |
| Tech Peer | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 |
| PM Partner | 3 | 4 | 3 | 3 |
| Skip-Level | 3 | 3 | 3 | 4 |

<!-- Talk track: Four interviewers evaluate the same candidate. The hiring manager gives mostly 3s. The technical peer gives mostly 2s. The PM partner gives a 4 on communication. The skip-level gives a 4 on curiosity. Now — is this a hire? You cannot answer that question without knowing what each person means by their scores. -->

---

# The Calibration Problem

**Average score ranges from 2.0 to 3.25 depending on the interviewer.** Is this a hire or not?

- Is the Tech Peer a tough grader, or did they catch a genuine weakness?
- Is the PM Partner's 4 on communication a high bar or a low one?
- Without norming, your debrief becomes an argument about what the numbers mean rather than what the candidate demonstrated

> Without calibration, you cannot tell whether disagreements reflect different standards or different observations.

<!-- Talk track: Without calibration, you cannot tell whether the Tech Peer is a tough grader who gives 2s to everyone, or whether they saw something the others missed. Is the PM partner's 4 on communication a high bar or a low one? This is the calibration problem. Without norming, your scores are just numbers without a shared reference point, and your debrief becomes an argument about what the numbers mean rather than what the candidate demonstrated. -->

---

# Calibrating Scorers: The Fix

### The Norming Session

**Before the interview loop begins:**
1. Score a **practice candidate** together (use a past work sample or a fabricated one)
2. Discuss every disagreement — "Why did you give a 2 on communication?"
3. Align on what each score means for each dimension
4. Document calibration notes for reference

<!-- Talk track: The fix is a norming session, and it is simpler than you think. Before your interview loop begins, get all interviewers in a room for 20 to 30 minutes. Show them a work sample — either from a past candidate anonymized, or one you fabricated. Have everyone score it independently. Then discuss. You will be amazed at how different the scores are. One person gave a 4 on communication, another gave a 2, and they were looking at the same work. Walk through each disagreement and align on what each score means. -->

---

# What Norming Prevents (1/2)

### Biases Addressed

- **Anchoring** to the first interviewer's opinion
- **Halo effect** — one strong dimension inflates all scores
- **Recency bias** — the last candidate always seems freshest
- **Similarity bias** — rating candidates higher when they remind you of yourself
- **Contrast effect** — a mediocre candidate looks great after a terrible one

<!-- Talk track: Let me name the biases that norming prevents. Anchoring to the first interviewer's opinion. The halo effect where one strong dimension inflates all scores. Recency bias where the last candidate always seems freshest. Similarity bias where you rate candidates higher when they remind you of yourself. And the contrast effect where a mediocre candidate looks great after a terrible one. -->

---

# What Norming Prevents (2/2)

### The Investment

- A norming session takes **20–30 minutes**
- It saves **hours of circular debrief arguments**
- It produces **better hires** because you compare candidates to a standard, not to each other

<!-- Talk track: Twenty minutes of norming prevents hours of circular debrief arguments later. It is the highest-ROI meeting in your entire hiring process. You are comparing candidates to a calibrated standard, not to each other or to each interviewer's personal interpretation of the scale. -->

---

# The Interview Loop: Who Interviews for What

| Interviewer | Focus Area | Why |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Hiring Manager** | Role fit + team dynamics | Owns the decision |
| **Technical Peer** | Depth of craft | Evaluates real skill |
| **Cross-Func Partner** | Collaboration + comms | Works with them daily |
| **Skip-Level** | Judgment + growth | Longer-term view |

<!-- Talk track: The interview loop is the structure around who evaluates what. Four interviewers, each with a distinct focus. The hiring manager looks at role fit and team dynamics. A technical peer evaluates depth of craft. A cross-functional partner tests collaboration and communication. And a skip-level manager assesses judgment and growth potential over a longer horizon. -->

---

# Why Four Interviewers

- **Four** is the sweet spot — fewer than three lacks signal diversity; more than five wastes everyone's time
- Each interviewer has a **distinct focus** — no one evaluates "general impressions"
- The cross-functional partner is often the most diagnostic — a PM who will work with this analyst daily can evaluate collaboration in ways no hiring manager can

> Google's People Operations research found that four interviews predict hiring outcomes almost as well as eight or more.

<!-- Talk track: Four is the right number. Research from Google's People Operations team found that four interviews predict hiring outcomes almost as well as eight or more. Beyond four, you get diminishing returns and a worse candidate experience. The cross-functional partner is often the most revealing interview. A product manager who will work with this analyst daily can tell you things about collaboration and communication that no amount of technical evaluation will surface. -->

---

# The Interview Loop: Independent Scores

### The Critical Rule: Independent Scores Before Discussion

1. Each interviewer submits scores **before** the debrief meeting
2. No peeking at others' scores
3. Debrief starts with a round-robin: each person shares scores and top observations
4. Hiring manager makes the final call — this is **not** a consensus vote

<!-- Talk track: The critical rule for the interview loop: everyone submits their scores independently before the debrief. No hallway conversations. No Slack messages saying "what did you think?" before scores are in. Why? Because the first strong opinion in a debrief anchors everyone else. If your VP walks into the room and says "I think she is great," watch how quickly every 2 becomes a 3. Independent scoring ensures you actually get four genuine data points. -->

---

# Why Independence Matters

- The first strong opinion in a debrief **anchors everyone else**
- Independent scoring ensures you get **four genuine data points**, not one opinion amplified by social pressure
- **Disagreements are signal, not noise** — when one interviewer says "strong hire" and another says "no hire," dig into why

> The hiring manager makes the final call. This is not a democracy. Consensus selects for "no one objected" rather than "someone was enthusiastic."

<!-- Talk track: And here is the nuance — the hiring manager makes the final call. This is not a democracy. Consensus-based hiring selects for "no one objected" rather than "someone was enthusiastic." But the hiring manager should take disagreements seriously. When one interviewer says strong hire and another says no hire, that gap is the most important information in the room. Do not average it away. Dig into it. -->

---

# The Debrief Meeting (1/2)

### Running an Effective Debrief

1. **Before the meeting:** All scores submitted independently. Hiring manager reviews for major disagreements.
2. **Round-robin:** Each interviewer shares scores and **one key insight** per dimension — not a 10-minute monologue.

<!-- Talk track: Let me talk about the debrief meeting because this is where many structured processes fall apart. The debrief should take 30 to 45 minutes. Before the meeting, all scores are submitted independently. The hiring manager reviews for major disagreements. Start with a round-robin — each interviewer shares their scores and one key insight per dimension. Not a 10-minute narrative. -->

---

# The Debrief Meeting (2/2)

### Focus on Disagreements and Signal

3. **Discuss disagreements first:** "You gave a 2 on Business Context and you gave a 4. Walk us through what you saw."
4. **Separate signal from preference:** "I did not like their style" is preference. "They could not connect analysis to a decision" is signal.

<!-- Talk track: Then go straight to the disagreements. If one person gave a 2 on Business Context and another gave a 4, that is the most interesting thing in the room. Have them both explain what they saw. And always separate signal from preference. "I did not like their style" is preference. "They could not connect analysis to a decision" is signal. -->

---

# Debrief: Reading the Patterns (1/2)

### When Interviewers Disagree

- **Strong Hire vs. No Hire on the same dimension** — the most informative signal. One interviewer may have probed deeper.
- **Consistent 3s across all dimensions** — often a "weak hire" signal. No one is excited. Be cautious.
- **One dimension drags the average down** — ask: is this coachable? A 2 on Technical Execution is harder to fix than a 2 on Communication.

<!-- Talk track: Watch out for the "consistent 3s" pattern. When every interviewer gives 3s across the board, it feels like a hire because the average is above the bar. But what it often means is that nobody is excited. That is a weak hire signal. When one dimension drags the average down, ask whether it is coachable. A 2 on Technical Execution is harder to fix than a 2 on Communication. -->

---

# Debrief: Reading the Patterns (2/2)

### The Hiring Manager's Call

- You have heard all the data. **You decide.** Do not hide behind consensus.
- A "strong hire" from the technical peer is worth more than lukewarm 3s from everyone else.
- When in doubt, do not hire. A false positive (bad hire) is far more expensive than a false negative.

<!-- Talk track: The hiring manager makes the call. Do not hide behind consensus. If you are not excited, pass. A "strong hire" from the technical peer is worth more than lukewarm 3s from everyone else. The cost of a false positive — hiring the wrong person — is much higher than the cost of a false negative. -->

---

# Candidate Experience: Your Employer Brand (1/2)

### Your Employer Brand Is Built in Rejection Emails

- **Timeline:** < 1 week between stages. Silence is a decision — the decision to lose good candidates.
- **Communication:** Proactive updates even when there is no update. "We are still reviewing" beats silence.
- **Rejection:** Specific, kind, and fast.

<!-- Talk track: Let me give you a number that changes how you think about hiring. For every person you hire, you reject about 19. Those 19 people will tell their friends, their colleagues, their social media followers about their experience with your company. If you ghosted them or made them wait three weeks, they will tell everyone. -->

---

# Candidate Experience: Your Employer Brand (2/2)

### The Math

- You will interview ~20 candidates for each hire
- 19 of them will tell their network about the experience
- **19 negative stories vs. 1 hire** — the ratio matters

<!-- Talk track: Your employer brand is not built in the offer letter. It is built in the rejection email. The analytics community is small — the analyst you reject today might be the hiring manager you need to impress in two years. Nineteen negative stories versus one hire — the ratio matters. -->

---

# Candidate Experience: Non-Negotiables

### The Minimum Standard

- Acknowledge every application within 48 hours
- Provide a clear timeline at every stage
- Give feedback with rejections (even brief: "We went with a candidate with deeper SQL experience")
- Never ghost a candidate who completed a work sample

<!-- Talk track: Here are the non-negotiables. Acknowledge every application within 48 hours — this can be automated. Provide a clear timeline at every stage — "you will hear from us by Friday" and then actually follow up by Friday. Give feedback with rejections. It does not have to be a detailed performance review. And the big one: never ghost a candidate who completed a work sample. That person invested hours of their life in your process. -->

---

# Going Beyond the Minimum (1/2)

- **Send the work sample rubric in advance** — this signals that you respect their time
- **Offer a 15-minute feedback call** to any candidate who completed a work sample
- **Close the loop quickly** — the best candidates have other offers. A 6-week process loses them.
- **Be honest about the role** — if the data infrastructure is a mess, say so. Candidates who join with realistic expectations stay longer.

<!-- Talk track: If you want to go above the minimum, offer a 15-minute feedback call to anyone who did the work sample. Close the loop quickly because the best candidates have multiple offers. And be honest about the role — candidates who join with realistic expectations stay longer than those who discover problems after starting. -->

---

# Going Beyond the Minimum (2/2)

> Even candidates you reject will walk away thinking "that was the most professional interview process I have been through." That is your employer brand.

<!-- Talk track: Even candidates you reject become ambassadors when you treat them well. The analytics community is small — the person you reject today might be your next hire's manager in two years. Your process is your employer brand. -->

---

# Building Your Employer Brand in Analytics (1/2)

- **Open-source contributions** — if your team builds tools that could help others, open-source them. Nothing says "serious data work" like a well-maintained GitHub repo.
- **Blog posts about your stack** — write about problems you solved, architecture decisions, mistakes you learned from. Candidates read these.

<!-- Talk track: I want to talk about the long game of employer brand in analytics. There are a few things that signal to the market that your team is a great place to work. First, open-source contributions — nothing attracts senior data talent like a well-maintained GitHub repo. Second, write about your work. Blog posts about your data stack and architecture decisions — candidates read these before they apply. -->

---

# Building Your Employer Brand in Analytics (2/2)

- **Speaking at meetups** — encourage team members to present at local data meetups or conferences. Visibility attracts talent.
- **Treating rejected candidates well** — every person who thinks "that was fair" becomes an ambassador.

<!-- Talk track: Third, encourage your team to speak at meetups. A 20-minute talk at a local PyData meetup puts your team on the radar. And fourth, treat your rejected candidates well. Every person who thinks "that was fair" becomes an ambassador. -->

---

# The Employer Brand Compounding Effect

- **Year 1:** Nobody knows who you are. You compete on comp and title.
- **Year 2:** A few blog posts, a meetup talk, good rejection experiences. Inbound pipeline improves.
- **Year 3:** Candidates apply specifically because they heard your team is well-run. You select from a stronger pool.

**The best analytics teams spend less time recruiting because their brand does the work for them.**

<!-- Talk track: This is not something you fix in a quarter. It compounds over time. Year one, nobody knows who you are and you compete purely on compensation. Year two, a few blog posts and a meetup talk later, your inbound pipeline improves. Year three, candidates apply specifically because they heard your team is well-run. The best analytics teams I know spend less time recruiting because their brand does the recruiting for them. That compounding effect is worth the investment. -->

# Activity: Build Your Hiring Packet

## 25 Minutes | JD + Rubric In Class

<!-- Talk track: Time to put this into practice. For the next 25 minutes, you will focus on two deliverables: your job description and your scoring rubric. These are the foundation of the hiring packet. Work sample design and interview loop design are part of your final portfolio — start them between now and Day 2. Use the templates provided. Work individually but feel free to ask questions. I will circulate. At the end, you will pair up for a role-play exercise using the rubric you built. -->

---

# Activity Brief: Build Your Hiring Packet (1/2)

### Your Case Context

Use the company scenario you chose in Block A (small / medium / large)

<!-- Talk track: Here is the specific breakdown. Use the company scenario you chose in Block A. In class today, you are building two things: the job description and the scoring rubric. Start with the job description template and fill in the 90-day outcomes first — that is your anchor. The work sample and interview loop are homework — part of your final portfolio. -->

---

# Activity Brief: Build Your Hiring Packet (2/2)

### In-Class (25 min)
1. **Job Description** — 90-day outcomes, responsibilities, qualifications
2. **Scoring Rubric** — Dimensions, 1–4 scale, behavioral anchors

### Portfolio Homework
3. **Work Sample Exercise** — Realistic task, dataset, evaluation criteria
4. **Interview Loop Design** — Stages, interviewers, debrief protocol

<!-- Talk track: In class, you have two deliverables: the job description with 90-day outcomes, and the scoring rubric. Focus your 25 minutes here. The work sample exercise and interview loop design are part of your final portfolio — start them between now and Day 2, building on the JD and rubric you draft today. You will have until the portfolio deadline to polish everything. -->

---

# Activity Tips

- Start with the 90-day outcomes — everything else follows
- Be honest about "required" vs. "preferred" qualifications
- Design the rubric so a stranger could use it and reach similar conclusions
- You will use this rubric in the role-play next — make it specific enough to actually score a candidate

> If you are stuck, start with: "What would make me confident this person can succeed in their first 90 days?" and work backward.

<!-- Talk track: A few tips. Start with the 90-day outcomes because everything else flows from there. Be honest about what is truly required versus merely preferred. Design the rubric so that a stranger could pick it up and reach similar conclusions to you — that is the test of a good rubric. You are about to use this rubric in a live role-play, so make it specific enough to actually score someone. If you are stuck, ask yourself "what would make me confident this person can succeed?" and work backward from there. You have 25 minutes — focus on the JD and rubric. Go. -->

---

# Role-Play Setup (1/2)

### In 10 minutes, you will pair up

**Round 1 (10 min):** Person A plays the candidate. Person B runs a structured interview using their rubric.

**Round 2 (10 min):** Swap roles.

<!-- Talk track: After the 25 minutes of building, we are going to do something uncomfortable and valuable. You are going to pair up and run actual structured interviews. One person plays the candidate using a profile card I will give you. The other person runs the interview using the rubric they just built. Then you swap. -->

---

# Role-Play Setup (2/2)

### How It Works

1. You will receive a **Candidate Profile Card** — play this person authentically, including their weaknesses
2. The interviewer uses their rubric and asks questions from their interview loop
3. After each round, the interviewer shares scores and explains reasoning

<!-- Talk track: Here is how it works. You will receive a candidate profile card — play this person authentically, including their weaknesses. The interviewer uses their rubric and asks questions from their interview loop. After each round, the interviewer shares scores and explains their reasoning. -->

---

# Role-Play: The Goal

- The "candidate" gives feedback: "Here is what felt fair, here is what felt unclear"
- Experience both sides of a structured interview
- Find where your rubric works and where it breaks down

> Play the candidate authentically — do not make it easy for the interviewer. If your profile says you are weak on communication, be weak on communication. The goal is to stress-test the rubric.

<!-- Talk track: This is where the rubber meets the road. You will discover whether your rubric actually helps you evaluate someone or whether it falls apart when a real human being is sitting across from you. Play the candidate authentically. If your profile says you are weak on communication, be weak on communication. The goal is to stress-test the rubric, not to practice being impressive. After each round, the candidate gives feedback on what felt fair and what felt unclear. -->

---

# Candidate Profile Cards (1/2)

| Profile | Archetype | Key Trait |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **A** | Strong Candidate | Solid all-around; slightly overqualified |
| **B** | Borderline | Good technical but communication gaps |
| **C** | Wrong Level | Impressive resume, wrong seniority |
| **D** | Culture Fit Trap | Likable but shallow technical depth |

<!-- Talk track: I am going to hand out candidate profile cards. Each profile is a different archetype you will encounter in real hiring. Profile A is the strong candidate. Profile B is the borderline. Profile C is the wrong level. Profile D is the culture-fit trap — charming and articulate but shallow technically. -->

---

# Candidate Profile Cards (2/2)

Each card includes: background, strengths, weaknesses, a "tell" the interviewer should catch, and suggested responses.

**Play the profile, not yourself.**

<!-- Talk track: Each card has suggested responses and a tell that the interviewer should catch if their rubric is well-designed. Play the profile, not yourself. The goal is to stress-test the rubric, not to practice being impressive. -->

---

# Debrief

### Reflection Questions

- **What signals were hardest to evaluate?**
  - Where did your rubric give clear answers? Where did it fail?
- **Where did your rubric break down?**
  - Missing dimensions? Ambiguous score definitions?
- **What would you change?**
  - About your questions, rubric, or scoring process?

<!-- Talk track: Let's debrief. Interviewers first: what was the hardest signal to evaluate? Where did your rubric give you a clear answer and where did it leave you guessing? This is the most important insight from the exercise — your first rubric will be wrong. Every rubric is wrong the first time. The goal is not perfection, it is iteration. -->

---

# Debrief: The Candidate Perspective

- **What surprised you about being the candidate?**
  - What felt fair? What felt arbitrary?

### Key Takeaway

A rubric is a living document. Your first version will be wrong. The goal is to **iterate** after every interview loop.

> After every real interview loop, update your rubric. Add a missing dimension. Sharpen a vague score definition. Remove a dimension that was not diagnostic.

<!-- Talk track: Now candidates: what felt fair about the process? What felt arbitrary or unclear? After every real interview loop, you should update your rubric based on what you learned. Add a dimension you were missing. Sharpen a vague score definition. Remove a dimension that was not actually diagnostic. The rubric is a living document, not a form you fill out once and file away. -->

---

# Hiring Anti-Patterns (Part 1)

### Quick Hits — What Not to Do

- **"Culture fit" as a criterion** — This is how you hire clones of yourself. Replace with "culture add" or specific collaboration behaviors. If someone cannot articulate what behavior concerned them, it is bias.

- **The 20-hour take-home** — Disrespects candidate time, biases toward people without caregiving responsibilities, and the best candidates will drop out. Two to four hours, clearly scoped.

<!-- Talk track: Before we close, let me walk through the hiring anti-patterns I see most often in analytics. First, culture fit as a criterion. This almost always means "this person is like me" and it is how you build a homogeneous team with blind spots. Replace it with culture add or specific collaboration behaviors. Second, the 20-hour take-home. The best candidates have options and will not spend a weekend on your exercise. And it biases toward people who have free weekends. -->

---

# Hiring Anti-Patterns (Part 1, cont.)

- **The "rockstar/ninja" JD** — Signals immaturity. Senior candidates run from these because they have seen what "rockstar culture" actually means: no process and no work-life balance.

<!-- Talk track: Third, the rockstar or ninja job description. Every experienced person reading it assumes your org has no process and no work-life balance. If your job posting uses these terms, delete them and describe what the person will actually do. -->

---

# Hiring Anti-Patterns (Part 2)

- **Ghosting candidates** — Especially after a work sample. The analytics community is small — the person you ghost today is the hiring manager you need to impress in two years.

- **Consensus-based decisions** — "Everyone needs to agree" selects for inoffensive mediocrity. The hiring manager decides.

- **Hiring for potential without structure** — "I see myself in them" is bias. Define potential in measurable terms: learning velocity, ability to navigate ambiguity, trajectory of increasing scope.

<!-- Talk track: Three more anti-patterns. Ghosting candidates after a work sample is reputation destruction. Consensus-based decisions select for the person nobody objects to, which is not the same as the person someone is excited about. And hiring for potential without structure — if you cannot articulate what "potential" means in measurable terms, you are just pattern-matching to your own background. -->

---

# The Meta Anti-Pattern

All of these share a common root: **substituting gut feeling for structured evaluation.** The research is clear — structure beats intuition. Every time.

<!-- Talk track: Notice the common thread across all these anti-patterns: substituting gut feeling for structured evaluation. That is the meta anti-pattern. Structure beats intuition. The research is unambiguous. -->

---

# Key Takeaways (1/2)

1. **Start with outcomes**, not skills — the 90-day scorecard drives everything
2. **Structure beats intuition** — 0.51 vs. 0.20, every time
3. **Work samples are your best tool** — test real judgment, not trivia

<!-- Talk track: Let me leave you with the five things I want you to remember from this block. First, start with outcomes, not skills. The 90-day scorecard is your anchor. Second, structure beats intuition — the research is unambiguous. Third, work samples are your best tool for analytics hiring because they test real judgment. -->

---

# Key Takeaways (2/2)

4. **Calibrate before you interview** — 20 min of norming prevents hours of debate
5. **Candidate experience is employer brand** — 19 rejections for every 1 hire

### Between Now and Day 2

Start your **work sample design** and **interview loop** — these are portfolio deliverables. Your JD and rubric from today are the foundation.

<!-- Talk track: Fourth, calibrate your scorers before you start interviewing. And fifth, candidate experience is employer brand — treat every candidate like they might be your next hire's best friend, because in data science, they probably are. Between now and Day 2, start on your work sample design and interview loop. These are portfolio deliverables. Your JD and rubric from today give you the foundation — the work sample and loop build from there. -->

# Up Next: Block C

## Roadmaps, Bets, and Alignment
### 15:30–17:10

<!-- Talk track: We will take a 20-minute break. When you come back, Block C is about roadmaps, bets, and alignment — how you decide what your analytics team works on, how you communicate priorities to leadership, and how you say no to the 80 percent of requests that do not make the cut. See you at 15:30. -->
